# Project Description
I developed a responsive, theme-based web application using React and CSS without relying on any external frameworks like Bootstrap. The project follows a React component-based architecture with React Router to manage multiple pages.

To handle dynamic data within functional components, I utilized React hooks such as useState. For consistent theme styling across all pages and components, I implemented a global state management approach using createContext and useContext.

The application is fully responsive, with CSS media queries ensuring an optimal experience on both mobile and desktop devices. Layouts and elements are arranged cleanly using CSS Flexbox, and effective spacing and styling are achieved through CSS Box Model techniques.
